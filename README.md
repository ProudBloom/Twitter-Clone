# The Woofer :dog:

 The full stack application that is a clone of a Twitter web service (Pretty basic one. For now... ðŸ˜‰).
 It was my first approach to create a back-end for a web application.

## Functionalities ðŸ”Ž

* Posting new woofs, where everyone can select a name and write a message to the others. 
* Viewing other's most recent messages, displayong author's name, message content and date of creation.
