# The Woofer :dog:

 The full stack application that is a clone of a Twitter web service (pretty basic one. For now... ðŸ˜‰).
 It was my first approach to create a back-end for a web application.

## Functionalities

* Posting new woofs
Everyone can select a name and write a message to the others!
* Viewing other's messages
You can browse through most recent messages, viewing the contents, their author and date of publish.
